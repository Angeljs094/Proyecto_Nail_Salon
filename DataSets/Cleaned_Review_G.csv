p.s i am always nice and friendly only issue is when i come in i ask for colors like crome rose gold and if they don't have it, i usually ask if they can mix the colors on a sample nail. but i always tip and am friendly, so they have no excuse to justify their behavior .",2019-04-10 00:22:10.891

my gel manicure:  the lady who did my nails was very nice.  i got a gel manicure. it turned out pretty (i will post pics).  i noticed all around the outside of my nails was paint, but i got a clear pinkish gel so you can't tell unless you look close. overall i was not blown away but the lady was sweet and it turned out pretty.

my first daughter's manicure and pedicure (
white polish with gold dots):  my daughters nails were not good.  the gentleman did a messy job.  nail polish all on the edges of her fingers...just sloppy.  sometimes i think they don't take the time with kids as they do with grown ups which is terrible...especially when i have to go home with a disappointed child :(. i went to sally's and got the colors she wanted and did it myself later.

my second daughter's manicure (coral with white polka dots): the lady that did my eldest daughter's manicure did a great job. super pretty and precise with the polka dots. my daughter was very happy.",2017-04-18 22:07:13.630

update 6 days later: i would not recommend here at all. in just six days two of my nails fell off. one fell off doing laundry and another one doing dishes. i will not be going back. i messaged lisa about it and she blamed me!!! saying my nail beds are too short which is funny cause i have gone to so many places and i have never had them just fall off. i spent 60.00 for a full set and my little girls nails to be painted(which hers also all came off during her bath). this was a bday gift and it's just sad that apparently she didnt know what she was doing.

i have been searching for a great nail salon for 3 years. i was told about this place through a family friend. i called to make an appointment and they were pretty booked before the 4th and after calling to asking for specific days she told me that she can take my name and number if an opening opens up she will call or have one of her nail techs call. within the same day lisa called me back and got me on the schedule before my bday. when i got there it was very nice and everyone was really nice. lisa was running a little behind but she made sure to let me know which was very sweet of her. i brought my daughter in to get her nails painted and lisa was wonderful with her. i also got a full set as well and the entire time she was easy to talk to and she did amazing work. i was very surprised and happy to see that she does it all by hand which u dont see anymore. i'm so happy i finally found a place that not only does amazing work but is very friendly. thanks lisa!!!!",2019-07-16 05:51:33.124

tonight i went to go get a pedicure. my kids were with me. my 2yr old was  running back-and-forth by the pedicure stations to the lobby.  my eight-year-old with keeping an eye on him.  my 2yr old ended up knocking the vase over that had long extended flowers coming out of the top(turns out a flower stem got caught on one of his tight curls).  all the customers asked if he was ok because the vase was glass.  i got up from my pedicure, which i was not done with, then went over to check it out.  my son was ok and everything was ok and i offered to go ahead and pay for the vase and i apologized so many times.  i grabbed my things and let the lady know that i wouldn’t be finishing my pedicure.  i go up to the counter to pay and all i see/hear is the lady and another worker asking each other how much they should make me pay for the vase. not one worker asked if my son was okay. not one worker cared. the lady still charged me for a full “lovely pedicure” and the vase.
i’m super upset because my feet aren’t done and yet i was still charged the full service when i didn’t even get the full service. $50 in total ($30 for the pedi & $20 for the vase). now i have to go to another salon and pay again for the same service. not to mention, i was there to get my eyebrows waxed on thursday night, and the lady messed them up and didn’t clean them up. they looked so bad that i sat in the parking lot doing them myself. and i still had to pay for the service because she said she did what she could...

like we all make mistakes... we are human. this could of happened to anyone’s kiddo. but it was my kiddo. i’ve supported this nail salon since they opened and had “happy hour” nail services, i’ve always been an amazing tipper even to the lady who messed my brows up, always been super polite and kind... and to think they couldn’t even ask me if my son was okay or charge me $10 less for my pedicure or give me a rain check to go back and have my services completed at a later time, really doesn’t sit well with me. working for a big medical group, i always go out of my way to assure amazing customer service because i would want that done for me. but tonight, was clearly not my time to receive that same amazing customer service i offer.

my business will go elsewhere now which is sad because i really like this place. but, the humanity and hospitality is obviously absent from this business. i was quickly unwelcomed and it was felt.",2018-03-18 03:10:29.877

they have a wide variety of colors and services. i have very sensitive nails and they do a great job with them. if there is something i dont like i explain that to them and they immedately correct the issue.

very friendly if you want them to be. i have seen the others reviews and cant confirm the statements are accurate. reviews always vary. give them a chance.. make an appointment and go in at off peak hours.. you will love them!! the owners are wonderful and very family oriented. they live locally and have lives outside of work just like everyone else. they still are open 7 days a week.

this is not a ghetto hood shop.  all employees and owners have full disclosure with their prices with signs posted in visible places disclosing prices and policies while you are being serviced.  they use the best salon quality products and most stylists are certified in different skill sets and product lines.  i have never seen shop full of highly qualified individuals that continously educate themselves and sponsor in-house training sessions.  they focus on making sound judgements and will not overprocess and destroy your hair.
during my stay there i have seen people destroy furniture along with their unruly children.  i have also seen people and their horrible children ruin bathrooms after one use and attempt to touch things that will cause injury.  this is a salon full of chemicals, hot items, and sharp objects why would of all places will you have children acting out or playing here?
in addition, i have seen biracial children and adults come in with heads looking like rats nests and admit to not doing anything to it.  why i ask would you come in or walk around  looking like this?  why do you want bleached hair and then permed hair on the same day? if you have biracial children or are biracial don't let your or your child's hair go unattended for weeks and then throw it off on someone else? learn how to teach your biracial child to tend to their hair and love it!  or learn how to do it yourself. no stylist wants to be held accountable for bald spots caused by your parental neglect.  would it be fair for the stylist to charge extra to take on this additional liability?
if you want a haircut why not schedule and appointment this is not smartcuts. why come in at the last minute?  it seems very sad that other minorities will downgrade a shop established to service them so harshly for such pettiness.  i have had every service in the salon and was willing to follow them to goodyear.  candi is great and the reason why i found this hidden treasure.  carol who is so outstanding with natural hair and has magical growing hands.  rasheen the owner holds her stylist to high standards and it shows in the service.  she is the queen of hair styling.  if i ever did move out of state i will definitely come back here for service!",2016-08-25 20:35:56.785

i've been looking for a good nail salon close to home, decided to walk in after reading the reviews about this place which touted excellent service and friendly staff. that was not the case. this review is long, if you want the reader's digest version here you go: worst customer experience ever, don't waste your time or money at simply natural nails. read on if you'd like to know why.

when i entered no one greeted me, a girl doing a pedi near the door finally looked up and asked me ""what you want?"" i said i'd love a mani/pedi, then she went back to what she was doing without another word. a young man rushed up then asked what i'd like, i repeated myself and he instructed me to pick a color then disappeared. for such a small place i was amazed at how the staff could disappear so completely.

after i had my desired color in hand i stood waiting but no one offered me a chair, finally after meandering back to the front and standing there for what felt like 5 minutes one of the ladies pointed towards some empty chairs, again without actually speaking. i made my way to a few empty chairs, stood there for a few minutes, finally another lady came and pointed to one and began filling the basin.

another long wait with no interaction starts making me angry, i get up to leave and another older lady comes and puts my feet down into the water, hands me a water bottle. no greeting, just hands me a laminated price sheet, i point to the basic $22 pedi. she starts in, still not speaking, i say i like her shirt, this gets a blank stare and awkward smile. she spends the time cutting, filing, and massaging talking to the other girls in a foreign language, not even looking at my legs or feet. someone asks if i want a mani, i decline even though that was my original intention.

when she applies the color, she stops after one toe, says something to another girl and disappears, i never see her again. another girl comes and starts applying my nail polish without any explanation. i ask the young man, now working on a lady beside me, if there's a problem. he says ""no problem, she just have a hard time with that color"" then goes back to what he's doing. the girl at my feet tells her customer, who she abandoned without a word, that she'll be done in a minute, finishes my color then goes back to her client.

i'm left sitting, awkward, not knowing if my original tech is coming back or not. after about 15 minutes i again ask the young man if there's a problem or are we done, he asks me if i'm ready to leave, i get up and walk to the front in a daze.

never had such a horrible experience, never in my life have i paid money to be ignored until today.
i will never go back, i suggest no one else does.",2018-09-09 01:55:52.554

i loved the pedicure experience i received the first time so much that i brought my partner in with me for the second time! we called ahead and made appointments, but one of the nail techs was still busy with a client when we got there. they seated us side by side and my tech got started on me while they told my partner to soak his feet in the tub–but they didn't have the jets on, and the water was cold. he had to sit there for over half an hour while the other tech finished her last client.

i understand there's nothing that could have been done to control the timing of whether somebody's appointment took longer than anticipated, but there was no acknowledgment of what happened in the bottom line. we weren't offered a discount for the wait, and were still charged full price at the end. my partner was also underwhelmed by his pedi, which is such a shame, especially since it was his first one and he already had to wait so long for it.

addicted to nails isn't a factory pumping out dozens of mani/pedi's at $20 a pop, rather than that (and much better for it) this salon is set up in an intimate one-on-one setting where you and your artist of choice get to consult, conversate, and even bond over an experience meant to be about self love. this salon is a place you can be yourself while treating yourself, without judgement or language barriers.

i've had my nails done by solina since she began her career in beauty and can honestly say she just keeps getting better! solina is an artist, a straight up artist, who sees each nail as a canvas awaiting her touches of color and creation. her attention to detail and drive to see you leave excited and eager to share her results sets her apart from any other nail ""tech"" i've ever met.

whether you're into acrylic, natural, long, short, stilettos, coffins, or anything else you can come up with, there is surely someone at addicted to nails (probably solina lol) who will be happy to help you. the name says it all: get ready to become addicted to (your) nails! 🤩🥰🤗💅💞",2019-04-05 03:12:27.282

my brows are perfect - not too thin, but arched nicely and actually make my eyes look bigger. normal acrylic full sets are only $25 - i got the $40 version, and my brows were $10. i left feeling pretty and very well taken care of - amazing for a salon located inside a wal-mart. joe didn't press me for extras and kim took a good while on my brows - it's clear they are both perfectionists. their young daughter was also there and i was very impressed with how both joe and kim managed to actively parent and interact with her while doing such an amazing job on me and the other client in the salon at the time. joe even told me to not just come back in two weeks - that i should see how my nails grow out and then call when i thought they were ready for a fill, which is customer service at its best. i'll be back!",2018-01-04 21:33:44.317

if you are looking to get your nails done,  please - rethink your decision

if you want uneven , unshaped , unsanitary service and poor customer service then come here ! lol

i have been doing my nails for years now, and i've never had such a bad experience like i did here

my usual nail salon ""glitter nail bar"" which is down the street was busy .. and me being on a time schedule due to an event , i decided to come here

they have such a limited color variety here -
the shaping to my nail that i requested pointy was horrible ( see pictures as proof)

the nail popped off on top of that once i went to my other salon for them to fix this mess they caused here at pink lotus

i waited 25 minutes for a question to get answered,  i had to get up and see what was going on .

and they tell me they cant match the color . okay , i understand that - asked how much for a nail polish change . never got a response.

i tell the lady to just cash me out for the 2 broken nails i needed fixed
and these fools want to charge me $15 ( see pictures, this is not $15 nor ""professional"" work

the lady tells me to speak with owner ( which he did my nails)
he proceeds to tell me

that i'm wasting his time - i quickly corrected him on whos time really got wasted

doesnt seen the poor quality in his work, while other customers in there clearly seen it.

haha , please close down your nail salon if you are going to do poor work .",2019-04-20 21:57:53.133

i love that they offer an individual bag of files and scrubbers for $1 to make sure your the only one they are touching. also, they line the pedicure basins with your own individual plastic cover so it is more sterile as well. i hate that it leads to more waste, but i also hate the thought of getting some kind of fungus or wart on my foot from others, so there's that...
the only reason for a 4 star review is that it is very busy, so make sure you make an appointment. if you don't it's a good wait before you get in. i also feel like there are a lot of little things that are up charged, but that is pretty universal in the nail shop game, so be ready to say no if your on a budget or pamper yourself and be prepared for a higher bill.
on another positive note to end on, they offer a ""punch"" card for $$$ off after you fill it up. i think that's a great customer perk!",2019-11-09 14:47:24.948

this was a last minute find, & am so glad we came across this exceptional nail salon & employees.

they fit my mom & i in for gel manicures an hr before closing. i was so thrilled with the service that i made a promise to come back next time for their dip! $30 for gel, & so worth it! lynne (i believe) did such a fantastic job, & was very attentive. she definitely knows what she’s doing, but it looked like all the ladies in there did!

today, i came in for a simple fill and opted for regular polish instead of gel as i have to change my polish a couple of times this week. the same tech that did my nails the other two times is who performed this nail maintenance. i was satisfied all the way up to the polish. i guess i didn't tip as much as desired because my service soon became rushed and less than optimal. (because the re-polish experience was positive, i won't go into detail.) after leaving the salon and having lunch, my nails still had not dried and were looking awful.

my nail tech knew my nails were not going to dry when i left. i realize this is a reactive review, but i literally was expecting my nails to come out as usual. unfortunately, i will be re-evaluating my nail salon as what i thought was a great replacement to my regular routine self-care maintenance.

i do appreciate them taking the time to re-polish and the wonderful lady that is a regular bringing my spirits out of the negative. i do recommend this place, but encourage the assertiveness of ensuring your service is performed as expected.

i tried it again on a whim 3 months ago, amazing difference. not only were my nails perfect the tech i had was careful and attentive.  the whole atmosphere was calming and enjoyable. and they were packed!

i've been back every 2 weeks since, manicure, pedicure, eyebrows and every time i've left happy and feeling like i actually got pampered. the last 2 or 3 times i've been helped by lei, shes amazing and is super sweet and cares about her clients.

oh, and that original guy i had is long gone, so i've decided to let that experience go since they've made some good changes to staff. otherwise they have been consistent in their quality and fair in their price.

they also have a good selection of gel color, not too many like another salon in the area that literally has upwards of 200 maybe more colors, that's too many! and not too little like another salon that has maybe 20 colors.  they have a happy medium of about 60 colors.",2019-04-19 14:27:24.299

but funny thing is i was told i can’t come back to there shop because i got mad at him i’m sorry i guess i was supposed to sit there let him do what ever he wants to do .lol that’s okay at 160$ every two weeks with my daughter i’ll tske my money elsewhere then maybe i won’t hsve to go in for a repair every other day and have some teck make my nails look crappy again ..
not good mangment at all they saw what he was doing they heard me ask him not to do it that way but know one said nothing.  a joke and it’s. not a crime to speak up for your self it’s your money your the consumer.in a business with such a language barrier it’s hard when your not be listen to .i did not commit a crime by raising my voice they still got there money .i believe the american mangers are afraid to do there job as mangers when it comes to the tecks .
so they see how crappy they did your nails or how they throw fits but do nothing it’s all on the client.
so if you unsatisfied with what your paying a lot of money for guess what they threaten you with the police and say your band from there shop .

for what i mever use swear words i raised my voice on the third time when i asked please dont fix my nail like that. well the manger at a different shop took a picture she couldn’t believe they let this teck do my nail like this fat thick and strait as a board no curve at all .
sad business worse are the mangers that clearly should not be ..and buy the way nevada state board of com’s otolaryngology banned that  cheese  grater and they use it still on there special pedi.
i’ll be making my own complaint with better business bureau and nevada state .
when a manger from a another store looks at your nail and says what did he do how could that manger let you walk out like this or better yet how did they let him do this .it by chance it breaks my whole nail bed will go with it .are nails have a natural curve this is why there is that hump if you will because of are own nails so if it did break then you’re nail will be okay mostly..
there was a lady there on one day my nail broke she came in asked if someone could fix her nails that were odd shape and tilted they asked who did them she said some guy who thru a fit when i asked him to fix it lol so you can see it happens but your not to make a big deal even tho it’s your money .just sit let them do your nails and pay good or bad they are right .look at my pic on there site black mate nails look st the middle finger

***edit***

i called today & asked if i could get a gel pedicure. i was told yes & then asked when could i get here. i said 3 minutes & i showed right up.

i was asked to sign into the kiosk so i did & checked gel pedicure as the service i wanted.

once i was sitting down i asked how much would it be for the gel pedicure & she told me $48, i said ok.

she started painting my toes & went over the coats twice & i asked if she was going to use the light. she ignored me & someone else heard me & said i was getting regular polish. i said i asked for gel & i picked gel on the kiosk. someone else chimed in & stated she did regular polish because she didn't have time to do gel. i said that should have been told to me prior to me sitting down because i would have went elsewhere.

after i paid i walked out with halfway dry polish & it smudged on my big toe. so i had to go back in before i even got to my car. this is exactly why i don't like regular polish & i wouldn't have wasted my money or time had i would have known i didn't have a choice.

i'm currently sitting in my car outside with the heat on high to dry my toes so they won't smudge again. (as i write this review)

i've been coming here for about a year now because it's close to my house but i probably won't be back after this.",2021-03-12 00:09:22.248

i really liked my nails but don't agree with paying an upcharge for something that's included at every other salon.

they took every precaution imaginable - locking the front door so only those that have an appointment could be inside, protective screens while you get your services, masks and face shields, individual tools and liners for each station, they even started wearing scrubs (not sure why?).

the prices have increased since the last time i was in, but supporting my local business is more important than an extra $5.

the one thing i appreciate most and this may be weird for some people is that there's no random chit chat. they don't try to strike up a major conversation with me and they don't talk to each other. i think that's very respectful.",2021-05-27 21:20:38.036

look how bumpy he only fill by cuticles never touched rest of nails.

i've been getting my nails done for 40 yrs. this is awful.

first day i put glitter to hide them
day two first break by getting in my purse.
today day 7 second break unloading dishwasher.

day 8 third break while folding laundry.

update: just called and ask for manager / owner
remember this place is advertising
under new management!

she said they come and go but not there now ! this is exactly what she told customer that called with complaint while i was there.

i told her what's going on and complaint against him .. nothing !!

recap 4 weeks ago i came to get full set and 8 days ago i stupidly came back for fills ... today i had to remove nails which took 2 minutes... no soak off needed .

i might as well just flushed my money down the toilet coming to this shotty shop !!!!

time to launch compaint against shop with .

i was then given an appointment for a set of acrylic nails, (come to find out after that wasn’t part of the package) but it was scheduled right after my pedicure. i had to get up and walk out of the school after almost an hour of my nails being torn apart. i left with uneven, sharp, bleeding and painful nails. i immediately went to my normal nail lady to fix them.

i contacted the school, and had a conversation with the owners. very nice people and was told to give them another try and finish my package of eyelash extensions. i also requested instructors to be present at my next appointment to ensure it was being done correctly.

made my appointment with a specific person as told by the owners, and was given another  person . i was not notified of this until i walked in for my appointment. i then layed for almost 2.5 hours and had not even one quarter of eyelashes done. i again get up and walked out after being notified it would be another hour or so.

contacted the owners again to notify them, and this time was ignored.

(mind you i saw this shop online and picked it because it had excellent reviews) she goes on to say "" i am way more exspensive then other nail shops i dont repair other peoples bad jobs, when you want nails that dont keep breaking any more call me and i will make you an appt.""... with a bad attitude.... i simply said ok and hung up no need to argue with an ignorant person...i was like to my self wow...really? this was such unprofessional behavior. i never asked her about the price she did not know what i can or can not afford. the attitude was unnecessary.  its not what you say its how you say it. she could have just said she does appt only and that she would love an opportunity to win me over as a customer. that she does high quality work and could have asked if i would like to mk an appt with when its time to get all of my nails done. honestly at that point i would have said sure and made an appointment and been anxiously waiting to see her.

in response to your response...
fyi: i am a professional model and business owner...$150 is nothing to me when spend $3000 + popping bottles whenever i feel like it and travel all over the world staying in 5 star hotels and have actually stayed in the worlds only 7 star hotel in dubai for photo shoots and vacation.you should never jump to conclusions and think that a person could not afford your services without discussing the price first... furthermore your shop is in the ghetto on the corner of assault and battery and the only reason why i was even willing to drive all the way over there (mind you i live no where near there)and check it out was because your work looked fabulous... no love loss.. your work once again is some of the best i have seen..fabulous...however, maybe next time you will think twice before you judge someone without knowing anything about them.
and by the way your response shows that everything i said was true about you and your attitude and exactly how the conversation went....if i were you i would definitely consider editing that original response you gave or just taking it down..just saying😊 once again still unprofessional,and just bad for business.",2016-08-30 06:17:37.747

1.  language barrier- most of the techs can not understand english and will get frustrated with you when they mess up due to their inability to understand what you are saying.

2. arrogance & arguing-  even when they do understand and you provide pictures of what you want, they proceed to do what they think looks best on you. so even though they pick the design they want for your nails ,you have to pay.  i have always paid but the last 2 times i walked out angry and resentful...

3.  lack of leadership- when i talked to the manager he stated the it was my fault that i picked a nail tech that could not speak english or do designs.  he suggested i call ahead, make an appointment,and tell the receptionist what i wanted so that i could have better results next time. i have spent anywhere from 115-130 on my nails to walk out disappointed.  i picked this place for convenience because it it literally across the  street but i had to write this review to warn others.",2020-11-30 06:36:38.765

1.1293768194687248e+20,Holistic Sommelier,0x80c8e98216c501e7:0x7dca2bc6080f9aa5,1.0,"greetings, i wanted to make you aware of an incident that happened into this facility, today.
my one year old son was caught into his first nasty, with a touch of undeniable, racism encounter...his playful self was laughing too hard and too loud for one client.
while being under the dryer, an hairdresser came at the request of her client to make my son stop being too loud, it bothered her (never mind that we were all subjects to their idiotic loud negative, gossipy conversations for over 15mn), i looked at my laughing baby and was puzzled, i told the hairdresser that
he was only one year old 😆 (i was playing cars with him), the client would be ok (i knew i was almost done with the dryer and would leave soon),
as i was under the dryer, i did not catch the nasty comment that followed, but my hairdresser and her clients did. it escalated fast once i realized how nasty that particular client actually was...an embolden aging, mean spirited white woman.

to hear a kid play too hard for over 10 mn seems to be too much for some i get it, however the nasty behavior following was a sad reminder of our current political climate, and had nothing to do with a laughing baby, no one in the salon was supporting this odd couple  (client and hairdresser). although i am proud to say that my hairdresser actually stood up, not only for me and my son sje also stood up for herself and for this divided nation(and she does not have any children of her own, amazing)
the client was first to use more vulgar wordings, to which i responded she should not use such language in front of a child. (that goes to tell you where she stood in terms of moral)

i am standing completely in support of my incredible hairdresser raylen, she came  out of nowhere, stood up for us and moved us to another section with the quiet assistance of the front desk representative.

the hairdresser and her client were nasty enough to symbolically close my door (knowing that the walls are not encased to the ceiling, which means that noise still carry on)

at first i have to admit, i was confused with the request of the idiotic customer..and even more with the hairdresser who agreed to carry on the nonesense message -to shut down a happy baby was for the least weird. but once i saw the eyes of the client, i could not contain myself, i will and am going to post this ridiculousness on social platform...
nothing about this situation felt or is right. if at first i felt sorry for susie tamras, the hairdresser, i do not any longer, this kind of passive and supportive  behavior is what emboldens this fringe minority of the population. all money is not good money, we make choices however difficult...even if this one was not to me...
she had many options 1-tell her client that it would be over soon, 10mn top, or 2- ask my hairdresser if it would be ok to move me further. she chose to ask me to shut my happy baby (have you tried to shut a baby up?).
i am understandable upset, more so by the action of the hairdresser than the silly ignorant woman.
as a  24 years military spouse, a small business owner and the mother of 3 children i have never seen such display of lack of courage, hypocrisy and cowardice.

and yes, i do get that most of us want quiet when getting our beauty on...however that wretched woman wanted to spread her negative vibes and shadows among us all, and did not care about what came out of her mouth,  if not she like me and most of us would have been quietly enjoying her services, instead of gossiping, and laugh at the contagious ability that kid have to bring you into the light. even if it was for 10-20mn.

nasty behavior should never be rewarded, and shame on susie tamras supposedly master stylist for not standing up or at least for standing down.

i am hoping that this message will make you address one way or another different ways to equally and respectfully resolve small and big issues.",2019-02-28 20:46:48.539

the lack of attention to detail was shocking. my friend left with multiple cuts on her cuticles, and bleeding. i felt bad for suggesting this place.

immediately after hanging up, i started calling around to other salons.  two in the immediate area had informed me that they have never needed to do 3 treatments to bleach dark hair.  2 treatments on very rare occasions but never 3.  they told me that dosha probably doesn't specialize in coloring and may not have much experience with very dark hair.

dosha called again after 15 minutes to let me know they don't even have the product to bleach my daughter's hair.  the receptionist seemed very unapologetic after i expressed my dissatisfaction, and even said it was ""out of their control"" since the product wasn't included in their delivery for that day.

what a poorly managed business.  how about calling me and letting me know we didn't need to come in?  how about carrying enough product in your store to run your business?  i have an appointment for a hair color and you're waiting on the product to be delivered that day?

since the appointment was with a new stylist, we were set up to get 50% off.  we also didn't have to pay since they didn't have the product to color her hair. the receptionist seemed to think this was enough reason to not be apologetic, as she kept bringing this up.

huge disappointment, especially for my daughter.",2020-11-22 03:20:10.345

my husband purchased a $70 gift certificate for valentine's day, which would cover me a set of nails and pedi. i called to make an appt and the gal answering said that the nail lady, angelina maul wasn't taking new clients. i explained i had a gift certificate and she said that angelina would call me back to schedule. she called and i again explained about the certificate. my appt was for 3 weeks out for a gel manicure. day of appt i show up 10,mins early. angelina was thrown off that i was there, asking what i wanted again. i showed her what i wanted and she suggested something else. so, i just went with the sparkly pink gel manicure. not exactly what i wanted, but it was good. i tipped 10 on top of my 35 charge. we scheduled for may 16th, a week,after her vacation to hawaii. (i learned of this as we chatted)

i called today, the day,before my appt to reschedule. lane who answered took then phone to angelina and i could hear her say, there is a lady who wants to change her appt on the phone, very sarcastically. angelina answered and sounded annoyed. i explained who i was and what i needed. she said well i don't have you down. in fact i don't even remember your name. (funny i have the business card and gift certificate she hand wrote me) she proceeded with and there is,nothing on thursday either. no sorry. no let's see if i can get you in. nothing. i said okay, and she said yeah,nothing in the books. i was so,astonished i just said, okay,good bye then. now i sit with a useless 25 certificate that i will never give to anyone because i wouldn't recommend them to anyone. the worst customer service ever.",2019-05-15 15:22:54.002

i could easily echo the sentiment of some of the other reviewers re: smell and a language barrier but, my frustration lies with something far more upsetting. in all of my time getting acrylic or gel nails/fills, i have never never never had a technician put glue on the underside of my natural nail, to glue the acrylic to the natural nail underneath. she still glued the nail to the top of my natural nail but, after she'd polished my nails and we'd used the uv light, she finished off this session by turning my hand over and gluing the underside. i came due for another fill and one of my nails is lifting (something that, had she not glued it down on the underbelly, could be ""easily"" enough remedied by lifting it off the rest of the way) and it is tortuous, bending my natural nail down and irritating the nailbed tissue underneath). every time i accidentally bump up against something, it sends pain through my whole finger, and it's throbbing now.

it's pretty clear when they're supervising someone new. usually they let me know if that's the case. if i ask questions they offer their expertise, which i appreciate because i know next to nothing about nail grooming and what colors look good with what skin tone.  when they're applying a color and are unsure about it, they apply one coat to a nail and verify it's what i want. sometimes i'm unsure about a color i chose and they tell me that with 2-3 coats it'll look ok, and they're right. there's always a thorough foot or hand massage during whichever service i'm getting. some of the techs have strong hands and it's almost a deep tissue massage, others have a touch that's more like a light swedish. they listen to me when i have weird requests like not removing the calluses on my feet. they do always try to upsell services like the organic pedi, but that's business and a couple of ""no thank you""s if i don't want to take them up on it and they move on.

i've never had a problem with the personnel here. the most flak i've ever gotten was from a customer and her granddaughter who were talking about me within my earshot as i was having a shellac mani done. the grandmother was explaining, over and above the explanation most kids would need and sliding into the gossip/trash talk realm, that i was getting ""fake"" nails put on, like i was having acrylics done or something? like there's anything wrong with acrylics anyway? not the case, but whatever. the nail tech and i ignored her and she left without fanfare.

four stars because the nail painting part of the pedicure can be hit or miss, mediocre (like i could do it myself at home as well mediocre) or great. depends on the technician and the day.

the teacher put hair dyed all over me and washed me off. she then found another student to finish the job who was very polite and i had actually had before. i got a nice hair cut and blow out but i still had to pay for that and the students awful bleach mistake. they fixed it for free but the whole thing should've been free because i spent the day there. i've been here many times before and know the students are students and not professionals.

i've had perfect nails and eyebrow waxes here and it may have taken a lot longer than a real salon i was still satisfied.  my hair is completely damaged and had to cut a few inches off of it but the color is alright. thanks to the teacher for doing it. the staff was very sweet and understood that i was not happy with the students mistake and kept checking in until i was satisfied.

i've always been interested in going to school here but after this i question what they are being taught. at least the second student was professional and didn't smell of pot. i am happy with the color that has turned out so far but it's going to take a long time for my hair to feel like hair again. i recommend making your appointment for first thing in the morning because you're probably going to be there all day.

when i got my nails done last month it was 2 hours and a basic trim will probably be an hour. but these are students who are learning and i was happy with their work until today.  the student who did my hair first and ruined it kept telling stories about being arrested, smoking and how she didn't like the school. how professional! i worry how she will go out in the real world of salons after they graduate

the school is very clean and nice and the seats and very comfortable. i would know because i just spent my whole day in them! most of the students are nice, dedicated and enthusiastic. but there are some bad seeds. it's always a gamble when going to a beauty school because you know they aren't licensed. but i would think the teachers would be more involved sometimes.

some of the teachers just let the girl doing my hair do it the wrong way. they give up on them. they like to stand on the side and hang out with the students who aren't working on clients. but some of the teachers, like the one who fixed my hair, actually do care and help. i can only say it's about a 50/50 chance you'll leave satisfied. or with any hair left.",2017-08-09 23:26:08.489

jennifer also does a killer eyebrow wax for my boyfriend who has wonderful thick eyebrows, she understands just enhancing the shape and not destroying it!!

been coming here for a year now as it’s walking distance from my house. definitely making an appointment guarantees ease for you, but they are accommodating for walk ins as well.
very clean place. always uses new sanitized tools for each person which is a must and they offer complimentary bevvys which is nice. festive for holidays which is always a fun treat.

my only complaint is they have a horribly small selection of shellac colors!!! and for someone who gets fun colors  and accent nails etc and switches colors up every two  to three weeks i’m a lil peeved and about ready to start bringing my own colors.",2017-12-12 19:26:22.577

while the therapist did an ok job she was 6 months out of school and english wasn't her first language so communication was not ideal for an injured back.  had the massage been 50% less in cost i wouldn't be writing this review, i don't mind paying well for a fantastic massage but it has to be worth the rate.  i do not believe the massage was worth $130.00 and had they listened to what i requested i would be there 4 times a month.  again, the therapist was very sweet and will probably do well with a couple more years under her belt.  i am sure sh'e treat you well however i cannot recommend the establishment since i couldn't have been clearer with my request.  after telling them i get regular massages i also would have expected at least a call asking how it was or if there was anything they could have done better.... but nothing.  sorry, you may want to check out chozu bath and tea gardens.",2018-08-10 06:05:57.950

i also got a gel ""manicure"" which was light on the manicure, and many of gel colors on the swatches were no longer available. the color i ended up with has already begun to chip--four days later. my cuticles were also sore immediately afterward since the tech used a nail file to break polish away from my fingers after the gel had set.

we left there an hour and a half later extremely displeased. 3 weeks ago i painted my nails dark red and added a clear gel top coat and cured it with my uv light as i always do. i completely forgot to remove it before going in for tips, but the man said he could remove it and it wasnt a problem. i was relieved to hear that, so i picked out a vibrant blue color, and told him that i wanted clear nails, except at the very tips i wanted a little bit of blue, and he said that was fine.
he soaked my nails in acetone, and after a couple of minutes, he was able to scrap about 60% of my old polish away. i figured that he would file away the rest, but instead finished the prep, and started attaching all 10 of the nail tips, even with my old dark red color still showing through. when i asked him how he would get the rest of it off from under the nail, he got annoyed and said, ""i'll take care of it, i dont want it there either"". i didnt know how, but i sat back and let him do his work, assuming he was going to somehow make it right. when everything was done and he was opening the blue polish for the tips, i was upset to see that all of the old red polish was all still there and very much noticeable, so i asked him if i could pick a different color to do something else, and again he was really irritated and said ""fine"". i grabbed a bottle of red polish and asked him if he would just paint them normal. so he did. the other thing is that i asked him (and i showed him a picture) to shape them a certain way, rounded but with a straight across tip, and he was ""sure, that's almond shape"" and then he pointed at the picture where the nail was straight at the tip, and he shook his head and said ""no"". he ended up shaping them round and pointy, and miniature looking, and a couple of them were very crooked. i didnt say anything, i have my own electric nail file at home, and knew i could fix whatever he was doing.. the next day, i noticed that the thumb tips he used were too small, and i can see my own thumb nail around the edges up to the top of my cuticles!
my oldest daughter had picked out 2 colors, blue and purple, and she asked the woman working on her nails to alternate colors.. the woman said yes. halfway through our session, about 15 people piled into the shop for pedi's and mani's... it seemed to me like maybe they were short staffed...? in any case, its like the woman working on my oldest daughter didnt want to waste time messing with 2 different colors, and instead painted her nails one color, and then got up and left. just like that... it was almost like all the other new customers that came in were suddenly more important than we were.. also the next day when i saw that my thumb nails were the wrong side, my daughter showed me hers, and i noticed that alost every single one of her tips were also the wrong size just like mine, too small, but worse than my thumbs!
my youngest daughter had asked also for 2 different colors, but also asked for hearts on her ring fingers, and then glitter polish at the end (she's 10). the man told her to choose one or the other, a painted heart or glitter polish, so she chose glitter polish. again, she got just a mani, and she was really happy with it until later, she showed me that almost every single one of her nails, the guy didnt even bring the polish up to her cuticles, theres about 1/2 inch of empty space between her cuticles and the nail polish.
all 3 of us got extremely poor service. a dear friend of mine had recommended this place to us, and i also was impressed by all of the positive reviews i read online. i have thought about calling to complain, but honestly i just dont feel like it would be worth it. we will definitely be going elsewhere for our fills in a couple of weeks.",2017-09-06 21:35:22.652

so as i went to pay, i told him he really needed to work on his customer service skills. he denyed being rude and started yelling.  i told him i was never going back there again. he yelled thank you.  i asked for the owner- he pointed to his chest. i laughed and said ""i should have known, you think that because you are the business owner that you can treat people anyway you want."" wrong, word of mouth travels fast and i have a lot of friends. i know exactly how my daughter felt,  because he's treated me somewhat the same on a less offensive scale tho.  man, he really should have just apologized and everything would have been fine. owner is extremely rude. i will never go back there again!",2017-08-06 01:11:22.390

i will not be going back to have them fix as my nails are very sore now from such repeat days of filing. i'm usually not too picky about my nails but this is becoming a normal thing now. they told me that the chrome doesn't always stay on. i have had the chrome 5 or 6 times before with no issue. i wish the team there and the owners the best and for the clients that are happy with the work they get i'm jealous.",2019-03-04 20:05:20.996

the massage was not so great and she just rubbed lotion on my feet and rushed us outside. i asked for flowers on my toes and the lady doing my nails said she doesn't do those....okay but i'm sure someone else in their salon knows how to make flowers right? anyways their loss i wont be coming back.",2019-03-06 01:23:52.056

my name is na and i am the new operating manager at envy nails. some of you may have been in the groupon muddle, i want to first apologize and secondly explain the situation...

roughly 3 months ago envy nails was sold and taken over under new management. prior to that in october-november a groupon deal went viral and sold over 2700 coupons. of that, 900 was successfully redeemed by the previous owner. sometimes before envy nails changed owners groupon paid the previous owners for 2700 coupons sold....

i'm not great at math but i can calculate that 1800 coupons paid by customers (like you) hasn't been redeemed.

long story short, i'm receiving 10+ phone calls from customers scheduling appts with groupon bought, and i love the phone calls for my business but i reluctantly have to turn them all down.

i apologize that the money you've paid went to the previous owner and she took off with it. but the new owner has no connection with the previous owner or the groupon deal. i've been in contact back and forth with groupon and we've came to the agreement that they would refund the last 1800 coupons non-redeemed. there has been a mass email sent out to all 1800 customers, if you haven't receive it please contact groupon's customer service representatives. they are more than happy to help and refund you.

thank you so much for understanding, and please do not let this situation discourage you from stopping by and pampering yourself. i hope you allow all of us at envy nails provide the services you deserve.

thanks again,
na",2012-06-14 17:42:45.452

only note, for acrylic design: they do painted nail art but not jewels or ombre. i happily chose a more simple design.

problem was at the end of the pay the manager which is the same lady i was on the phone with randomly changed the prices and told me it’s 45$ !! which is out of line. i called other shops they were 40 and i stopped by bc of kin & the manager confirmed pedi with gel is 35$ twice !! how do u change the prices like that?

came in with great vibes and end up leaving pretty shocked & upset. they only take cash too so i only had a 50$ bill which the left over was suppose to be for kin. but obviously she messed up on purpose & didn’t even apologize. how ridiculous they handle their business. they deserve a 1 star 👎🏻 the star is for kin not anything else. . .

the chair i was in got stuck moving forward and doesn’t go backward so it wasn’t as comfortable. kin did a great job with my pedicure so it made things bit tolerable. i just wanted to get in and get out. end of review, i am not returning here. thx but no thx , super dishonest & bad management. . 👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻",2019-07-04 02:58:48.525

i'd come here a couple of times to get eyelash extensions from lisa, and they were pretty good. then the last time i went in, i don't know what happened, but not only were the lashes too thick, but many of them were glued to the skin on my eyelids instead of glued on my eyelashes. it hurt, and the pain would have gotten worse if my eyelashes had started to grow out, pulling my eyelid skin with them. they next day, i went to another place and paid $65 to spend 1½ hours getting them removed (which broke a lot of my natural eyelashes), and then one of my eyes was infected, so the next day i paid $25 for antibiotic eyedrops for my eyes. i went back to golden nails and asked for a refund of just what i'd spent on the extensions, but they would only give me a gift certificate for the price of the extensions, not including the tip—and that was after i argued. i don't want to go back there, so now i'm out a lot of money and have a useless gift certificate.

i'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 because at least i did get the gift certificate. maybe i can sell it below face value to someone else who wants their nails done, or something. mistakes happen, but i wish they had returned my actual cash money that i had paid, especially since the ordeal ended up costing me a lot more money.",2020-01-24 02:50:12.699

in general the experience was great. i had deluxe (i believe, maybe called luxury) manicure and pedicure (with hot stones) and it was great. relaxing and enjoyable.
4 stars because the end of the manicure felt unnecessarily rushed and the manicurist didn’t take time with the top coat and it’s noticeable.

pedi- i had stubbed my toe the night before, and knew i was going in so i waited for them to fix it. it was jagged still, they didn't file it down. kept clipping my skin around my toes but not the nails or cuticles.
most painful mani/pedi i've ever gotten. and if the massage chair had worked full force, it might have been bearable, but it wouldn't run the full body. would only stay on the shoulders then would get stuck and stop, making it uncomfortable to sit.

(my middle toe was still bleeding.) after that she stood up and pushed the button to push my chair back, and i assume she was letting me know it was time to leave.  meanwhile my friend was just beginning to get her legs massaged, although we'd started our pedicures at the same time and were paying for the same services.  i stayed and waited in my chair until my friend's pedicure was done, which was something like another 20 minutes.  all-in-all- we were in there maybe an hour and a half, and my friend got great care the entire time while i was ignored more than half of that time.  my friend said i should just pay for the $22 basic pedicure since i got barely even that, but when i tried to pay them $22 i was told that i got the more deluxe one that was $30  i tried to explain that i really didn't get a deluxe pedicure, but still had to pay the $30.  at first i figured that i'd just ask for mai next time, but now i don't think there will be a next time. i prefer galaxy nails in lacey. they always treat me well there.",2018-04-21 05:46:47.383

first time i came, four of my nails we're uneven and i said so six times, still no fix. i had a friend of mine ask too.. still no fix.

so $80 later, i probably won't be going back.

they are fast, it generally takes 45 minutes for a pedicure/manicure. not sure about the quality of the topcoat, my manicure doesn't last that long, although i've had that issue at many places; women who work cannot keep their nails painted long i suppose. the pedicures last the entire month. we get a latte at the espresso place before and sometimes go to garlini's after, so it's a nice afternoon out at a good price.
i'm not a diva, i don't place myself above others, but i'm pretty picky and sensitive to ambiance/personality, it's not just about the service for me. i won't go back if there is a bad ""vibe"". (the absolute best manicure i ever had was by a young man who clearly didn't want to be there-a family business-i wouldn't go back there). if i leave feeling better than i went in and my nails look good, i go back. we like this place.",2018-12-12 18:21:41.005

off we went, not knowing what to expect.  we were delighted!  we were greeted pleasantly upon our arrival, the services we needed were clarified, and we both had pedicures in progress within five minutes of our arrival.  there are several cosmetologists/manicurists on staff, so we each had our own person working with us.  the skill levels of the manicurists excellent.  they were fast, but gentle and proficient.  the water for the pedicure was pleasantly warm, but we were asked several times if the water temperature felt okay.  the foot and leg massage was heavenly.  loved it.  we both had polish on our toes and were off to the next step in a very short, but adequate time

the manicure was fast, efficient, and very thorough.  i was asked how i like my nails shaped, what color polish i wanted, and she constantly rechecked her work, making sure my nails were smooth and even.  the brow wax seemed like it was finished before it started.  aside from the normal pulling of the wax off my skin, it was a very pleasant and effective experience.

i rated cathy's nails with five stars for (1) willingly accommodating us into their already busy schedule without any delay; (2) having obviously experienced manicurists and waxers who care about their customers and the work they do.  i was very pleased with their service and plan to set an appointment six weeks from now.  also of note, my sister and i were accustomed to paying $75 and $55 respectively with our prior manicurist.  not only did cathy's nails' staff do a superlative job, the fee was $43 for me and $25 for my sister.  great service and a bargain price.  what more can we ask?",2015-03-14 20:12:42.402
